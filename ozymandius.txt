Ozymandius - by Percy Bysshe Shelley

And she be like, "He's so perfect"
I be like, "Oh, what version?"
"Ain't nobody got me this nervous"
Oh baby, I've been there (Hey)
And right in that same position (Hey)
So, baby, don't get this twisted (Hey)
No, nothin' could make me miss it
Take him, he's yours
